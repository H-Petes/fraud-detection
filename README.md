Credit Card Fraud Detection

     In this first step you are going to analyze the dataset
     Is there any Null value in your dataset?
     Display the columns of the dataset
     Display in percentage the different case(No Frauds, Frauds) present in the dataset
     Use different colors in other to visualize the distributions of the different case
     Plot the distribution of of the transaction Amount and transaction time
